# Parallel Programming Projects: Pthreads & OpenMP

This folder contains a collection of parallel programming applications developed using **Pthreads** and **OpenMP** in C. These projects were created as part of coursework and experimentation in high-performance computing and parallel processing.

## Topics Covered

- Multithreading with Pthreads (POSIX threads)
  - Thread management
  - Synchronization primitives
  - Race condition avoidance
- Shared-memory parallelism with OpenMP
  - `#pragma` directives
  - Reduction and critical sections
  - Parallel loops and sections

## Requirements

- GCC or Clang with Pthreads and OpenMP support  
- Linux or macOS environment (Windows via WSL or MinGW)
